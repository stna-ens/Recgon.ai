## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Canonical build order: A→B→C→D→E from SUMMARY.md (single-dev, sequential; FEATURES.md parallelization rejected).
- Phase 3 (LLM Judgment) and Phase 5 (Live Code Infrastructure) flagged for `/gsd-research-phase`.
- All v3 work is additive — no schema mutation on `agent_teammates`; `profileMerge` is the read-path.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Open research questions surfaced for in-plan resolution (not blockers, but flagged):
  - profileMerge weight ratios (Phase 1) — needs simulation vs `agent_tasks` history during plan.
  - Batch judgment prompt design + bias-test fixture set (Phase 3) — needs `/gsd-research-phase`.
  - GitHub App vs user-OAuth for live analysis (Phase 5) — needs `/gsd-research-phase`.
  - `task_reframe` volume at scale (Phase 4) — verify Gemini Flash quota headroom during plan.
